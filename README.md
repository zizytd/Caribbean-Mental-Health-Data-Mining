# Caribbean-Mental-Health-Data-Mining
In June 2021, I published an evaluation of the resources for youth mental health care in Jamaica (and to some extent the wider English-speaking Caribbean):https://www.capricaribbean.org/documents/mind-gap-inadequacy-mental-health-services-children-revised-october-2021. While the study was well received nationally, I felt that the report was not as comprehensive as it could have been as there was an absence of pertinent pieces of information and practitioners' inability to share more granular data. I decided to measure the prevalence of certain mental health disorders across the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in an attempt to give more context to the findings in the report. This Notebook is the second component of that project and showcases the results of a sentiment analysis on Twitter.
