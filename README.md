# Caribbean-Mental-Health-Data-Mining
This is a Twitter Sentiment Analysis of mental health in select Caribbean countries
In June 2021, I published an evaluation of the resources for youth mental health care in Jamaica (and to some extent the wider English-speaking Caribbean):https://www.capricaribbean.org/documents/mind-gap-inadequacy-mental-health-services-children-revised-october-2021. While the study was well received nationally, due to budgetary constraints, the absence of pertinent pieces of information as well as practitioners' inability to share more granulae data, I felt that the report was not as comprehensive as it could have been. I decided to measure the prevalence of certain mental health disorders across the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in an attempt to give more context to the findings in my qualitiative study. This Notebook is the second component of that project and showcases the results of a sentiment analysis on Twitter.
